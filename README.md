# Fellowship

Notice of incomplete CSS: Fellowship is an application I'm building for my own learning. Some features may be underdeveloped as what supports my learning doesn't neccesarily track one to one with what makes a great app.

Remember names and anything else. Study your friends, be a better friend.

## Why?
"Become genuinely interested in other people"

"She smiled, she laughed, she waved. Using the reminders and lists she kept in her notebook, she asked after families, new births, and favorite axehounds. She inquired about trade situations, took notes on which lighteyes seemed to be avoiding others. In short, she acted like a queen." - Brandon Sanderson describing Navani Kholin, Rhythm of War

Why not Siri?
Siri intents handle stricyl formated comands like "play my audiobook" and not unstructured comands like "find my mate with the blonde hair who doesn't have a job".

## Creating a project

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
